    Stock-Dash was built as my second full stack capstone for Bloc.
    <br />
    <br />
    The idea for Stock-Dash came from my interest in trading stocks. The dashboard allows you to get the latest news and pricing for a symbol, as well as see the past month's price data visualized. With the watchlist feature you can easily navigate to your top 5 and keep an eye on your favorite tickers.
